# General Information

During the course, we will use various image analysis programs to work on real-life data-based 
image analysis questions. These programs will be available to you on the University of MÃ¼nster's
 JupyterHub and the analysis server "The HIVE".

We kindly request that you bring your laptop to the course. However, a high-performance 
laptop is not required. You also don't need to install any programs prior to the course. 
You will only need to:

1. log in to the [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.uni-muenster.de/) and
2. be able to establish a Remote Desktop connection.
