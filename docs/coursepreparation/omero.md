# OMERO

OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is a powerful, open-source platform designed
 to help researchers store, organize, view, and share microscopy images and associated data. 
 It acts as a centralized, secure data repository that supports long-term storage, making it 
 ideal for managing the full lifecycle of your image data—from acquisition to publication.

With OMERO, you can:

- Access your data from anywhere using a desktop app, a web browser, or even third-party software.

- Support over 140 image file formats, including all major microscopy formats—no need to convert your files.

- Collaborate easily, sharing images and metadata with your lab or external collaborators.

- Keep your data safe, stored on a central server instead of scattered across individual machines.


We host our own OMERO server at the university Münster.
