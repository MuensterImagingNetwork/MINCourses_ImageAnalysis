## Typical Image Processing Steps in Fiji (ImageJ)

!!! tip "Learning Objective"
    Understand and apply the typical steps of an image analysis workflow in Fiji to transform raw microscopy data into meaningful quantitative results. By the end of this section, you will be able to combine Fijiâ€™s core tools to preprocess images, segment relevant structures, and extract measurements from your data.

### Rember: The Image Analysis Workflow: A Path to Results

An image analysis workflow is a sequence of operations that transforms your raw image into quantitative results. While there are often several ways to reach your goal, a typical workflow involves:

- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning up the image to improve data quality, for example by removing noise or correcting uneven illumination.
- **Segmentation**: Identifying and isolating objects or regions of interest (ROIs) that you want to analyze.
- **Measurement**: Quantifying properties (such as area, intensity, or shape) of the segmented ROIs.

The art of image analysis lies in selecting and optimizing these steps to reliably extract the information you need from your images.

### Core Steps and Tools for Image Analysis in Fiji
Fiji provides a vast toolkit for image processing. Here are some common steps you'll encounter, often used in sequence:

*	**Set Measurements:**
	* `Analyze > Set Measurements...`: Select the specific measurements you wish to extract, such as area, mean intensity, shape descriptors, perimeter, and more. This step defines what quantitative data Fiji will extract in later analysis steps.  
*	**Select ROIs (Regions of Interest):**
	* Use the Rectangle Tool or Wand Tool (toolbar buttons) to manually select objects or regions in your image. The Rectangle Tool allows you to draw a rectangular ROI, while the Wand Tool selects areas of similar intensity by clicking inside an object. Once selected, you can manage multiple ROIs using the ROI Manager (`Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager...`, or press `t`).
*	**Measure:**
	* `Analyze > Measure (M shortcut)`: Measures the defined properties (from Set Measurements) for the currently selected ROI. Results for each measurement are added as a new row in the Results Table.
*	**Results Table:**
	* The Results Table is where Fiji outputs all measured values. Each row typically corresponds to an individual measurement (e.g., one ROI or particle), and each column corresponds to a specific measurement parameter (e.g., area, mean intensity). You can copy, save, or further analyze the data directly from this table.
* **Subtract Background / Denoise:**
    * `Process > Subtract Background...`: Corrects for uneven illumination.
    * `Process > Noise > Denoise...` or `Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur...`: Reduces random noise, making subsequent steps more reliable.
* **Median Filter:**
    * `Process > Filters > Median...`: Effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges better than a simple blur.
* **Thresholding:**
    * `Image > Adjust > Threshold...` (e.g., using Otsu's method): Converts a grayscale image into a binary image (black and white) by separating pixels into foreground (objects) and background based on their intensity.
* **Binary Operations:**
    * `Process > Binary > Options...` (then `Close-`, `Open-`, `Fill Holes`, `Erode`, `Dilate`): Refine binary images. For example, `Close-` (dilate then erode) can fill small holes within objects and smooth their outlines.
* **Watershed Segmentation:**
    * `Process > Binary > Watershed`: Separates touching objects in a binary image, often used after thresholding when objects are clumped together.
* **Analyze Particles:**
    * `Analyze > Analyze Particles...`: Measures properties (area, shape descriptors, etc.) of objects in a thresholded binary image and can generate ROIs for each identified particle.

These tools, when combined thoughtfully, allow you to build powerful workflows to solve many common image analysis challenges. The following practical exercises will guide you through applying these steps.
