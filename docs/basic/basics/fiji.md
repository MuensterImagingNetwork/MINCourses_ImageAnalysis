## Fiji
### **What is Fiji?**  
Fiji stands for “**Fiji Is Just ImageJ**”. Fiji is an open-source image processing package based on [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/). It is designed for scientific multidimensional image analysis and comes with a curated set of powerful plugins. 

### What is Fiji used for?
Fiji is widely used for biological image analysis, including tasks such as image segmentation, registration, tracking, and visualization of data from a variety of microscopy techniques.


### Strength through plugins:  TrackMate, Coloc2, Weka, Bio-Formats, StarDist, and more  
Fiji’s power lies in its diverse ecosystem of plugins. Notable examples include:

- [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate) for cell tracking, single-particle tracking, and lineage analysis  
- [Coloc2](https://imagej.net/plugins/coloc-2) for colocalization analysis  
- [Trainable Weka Segmentation](https://imagej.net/plugins/tws/) for machine learning-based image segmentation  
- [Bio-Formats](https://imagej.net/formats/bio-formats) for reading and writing more than 150 proprietary microscopy file formats  
- [StarDist](https://imagej.net/plugins/stardist) as a state-of-the-art deep learning tool for object detection and segmentation in microscopy images  

This extensibility makes Fiji highly adaptable to new scientific developments and specific research needs.
