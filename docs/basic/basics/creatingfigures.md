### Creating Figures


**Creating Figures with OMERO.figure**

To simplify the process of making publication-ready figures, we provide OMERO.figure, a companion tool that makes figure creation intuitive and fast.

Each panel in OMERO.figure is actually an interactive image viewerâ€”allowing you to:

- Zoom and pan,

- Adjust display settings (channels, contrast, etc.),

- Scroll through Z-stacks or timepoints.

When you're ready, you can export your figures as high-quality TIFF images or PDF files, which can be directly imported into tools like Adobe Illustrator for further editing.
