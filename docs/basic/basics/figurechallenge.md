## 🎨 **Final Challenge: Create a Publication-Ready Figure in Fiji!**

### 🏁 **Your Mission**

You've now learned the basics of image analysis—congrats! 🎉
It's time to apply your skills in a real-world scenario:

**Create a beautiful, publication-quality figure of a multi-channel microscopy image using Fiji.**
You are preparing a figure for your next high-impact paper—or a conference poster you’re proud to stand next to.

### 💡 Pro Tips

| ✔ Do This                         | ✘ Avoid This                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Use high-contrast color schemes   | Red-Green combinations (colorblind!) |
| Show all relevant single channels | Only showing merged RGB              |
| Include a clear scale bar         | Missing spatial context              |
| Crop to ROI for clarity           | Showing irrelevant background        |

### 🧭 **Your Tasks**

#### 🖼️ Step 1: Choose a Multi-Channel Image

* Use an image with **at least 2–3 channels** (e.g., nuclei, cytoskeleton, membrane).
* Open it in **Fiji** (`File > Open` or drag & drop).

#### 🎨 Step 2: Color Your Channels

* Use **`Image > Color > Channels Tool`** to assign a color to each channel.

  * DAPI 
  * Actin 
  * Membrane or tubulin 
* Adjust visibility and brightness for each channel.

> 💡 Tip: Don’t just slap on colors—think about contrast and what tells your story best. 

🔴🟢 Avoid Red-Green Combos!
Current best practices recommend avoiding red-green color combinations, as they can be difficult to distinguish for 
individuals with color vision deficiencies. Instead, use high-contrast, colorblind-friendly palettes like magenta & green, blue & orange, or grayscale. 
Your figure should be accessible to everyone—including your future co-author or reviewer!

---

#### ✨ Step 3: Enhance Your Image (Carefully!)

* Apply **Gaussian Blur**, if needed, to reduce noise (`Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur`).
* Don’t overdo it—your image should be informative, not misleading!

> 🚨 Science first! No Photoshop fakery—stay true to the data.

---

#### 🔲 Step 4: Create Insets (Zoomed Views)

* Use **`Image > Duplicate`** to crop and zoom into an interesting area.
* Create a square or circle around your zoom area using **ROI tools**.


> 🔍 Zoom in on an interesting cell, a mitotic figure, or something weird and wonderful!

---

#### 📁 **Step 5: Duplicate and Save Individual Channels**

* Duplicate each single channel from the composite (`Image > Duplicate`).
* Create RGBs from each single channel.
* Save them individually as images (`File > Save As > Tiff`).
* Maybe you'd like to add labels and Scale bar to your image - see Step 6!

---

#### 🖍️ Step 6: Add Labels and Scale Bar

* Add **channel labels** using the **Text Tool**.
* Add a **scale bar** via `Analyze > Tools > Scale Bar`:

  * Set appropriate size (e.g., 10 μm)
  * Choose location and color for visibility

> 🧭 Reminder: a figure without a scale bar is a crime against microscopy.

* Convert all your labeled images to RBG and save them.
---

#### 🖼️ Step 7: Create the Final Figure

* Arrange images (composite and channels) into a figure in your program of choice (e.g Powerpoint, Inkscape).
* Include:

  * Single channels + composite
  * Original image and Zoom-ins, connected by appropriate lines
  * Clear labels and scale bars
  * Color legend, if needed

---

#### 💾 Step 7: Save Your Masterpiece

* Save as a **.tif** (preserves image quality)
* Export your final figure as **.png** or **.pdf** for presentation or printing

> ✨ Give your file a proper name like `Fig1_YAPTAZ_merge_insets.tif` (not `untitled5_final_realfinal2.png` 😉)

---

### 🏆 **Bonus Challenge**

* Add quantification: measure signal intensity in a few regions and annotate.
* Use **Look-Up Tables (LUTs)** for creative but meaningful coloring.
* Combine two fields of view into a comparative panel.
* Write a proper figure legend describing what is shown on your image.
