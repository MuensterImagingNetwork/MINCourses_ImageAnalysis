### Basic Principles of Image Analysis
We highly recommend the excellent image analysis book [**Introduction to Bioimage Analysis**](https://bioimagebook.github.io/index.html) by Pete Bankhead.

It’s an outstanding resource for anyone interested in bioimage analysis—from beginners to experienced researchers. The website offers clear explanations, practical examples, and is regularly updated with the latest techniques. Definitely worth a look!
