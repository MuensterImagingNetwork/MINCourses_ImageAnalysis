# Basic Principles of Image Analysis
We highly recommend the excellent image analysis book [**Introduction to Bioimage Analysis**](https://bioimagebook.github.io/index.html) by Pete Bankhead.

It’s an outstanding resource for anyone interested in bioimage analysis—from beginners to experienced researchers. The website offers clear explanations, practical examples, and is regularly updated with the latest techniques. Definitely worth a look!

### Image Processing and Analysis: From Raw Data to Meaningful Measurements


Microscopy images are rich sources of information, but extracting quantitative data often requires a two-pronged approach: **Image Processing** followed by **Image Analysis**.

**Image Processing** involves manipulating an image to improve its quality, enhance features, or prepare it for analysis. The output of processing is typically another image. This is where you'll "tweak" and "process" a *copy* of your original data.

**Image Analysis** is the subsequent step where you compute meaningful measurements from the processed (or original) image, such as object counts, sizes, or intensities.

The primary goal is often to derive these quantitative insights (analysis), but robust processing is almost always essential to accurately identify the features you want to measure.

!!! tip "Work on a Duplicate!"
    Always perform processing steps on a **duplicate** of your original image. This preserves your raw data, allowing you to revisit it or try different processing strategies. The final Regions of Interest (ROIs) generated from the processed image can then be applied back to the original, unaltered image for accurate measurements (e.g., intensity).

### The Image Analysis Workflow: A Path to Results

An image analysis workflow is a sequence of operations that transforms your raw image into quantitative results. While there's often more than one way to achieve a goal, a typical workflow involves:

1.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaning up the image (e.g., removing noise or uneven illumination).
2.  **Segmentation:** Identifying and isolating the objects or regions of interest (ROIs) you care about.
3.  **Measurement:** Quantifying properties of the segmented ROIs.

The art of image analysis lies in selecting and optimizing these steps to robustly extract the desired information.

!!! success "The Core Strategy"
    A common and powerful strategy is:
    1. **Duplicate** your original image.
    2. **Process and tweak** this duplicate extensively to clearly define the structures you're interested in.
    3. Generate **Regions of Interest (ROIs)** based on these defined structures.
    4. Apply these ROIs back to the **original, unprocessed image**.
    5. Perform **measurements** (e.g., intensity, area, shape) within these ROIs on the original data. This ensures your measurements reflect the true signal without processing artifacts.
