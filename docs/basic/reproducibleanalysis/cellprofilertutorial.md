The data we will analysis today, is derived from this research paper: 

>***Analysis of YAP/TAZ localization in triple negative breast cancer in response to Rho GTPase regulators*** <br>
Pascual-Vargas P, Cooper S, Sero J, Bousgouni V, Arias-Garcia M, Bakal C., Scientific Data, 2017

### Research question for today:

**What is the YAP/TAZ ratio between nucleus and cytoplasm?**

Create an image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler to calculate the 
YAP/TAZ ratio between nucleus and the cytoplasm in this dataset.


**Analysis strategy:**

- (Image preprocessing)
- Segment nuclei and cytoplasm
- Assign each cytoplasm one nucleus
- Measure intensity parameters for nucleus and cytoplasm
- Calculate Yap/Taz Ratio
- Export the results
