The data we will analysis today, is derived from this research paper: 

>***Analysis of YAP/TAZ localization in triple negative breast cancer in response to Rho GTPase regulators*** <br>
Pascual-Vargas P, Cooper S, Sero J, Bousgouni V, Arias-Garcia M, Bakal C., Scientific Data, 2017

### Research question for today

**What is the YAP/TAZ ratio between nucleus and cytoplasm?**

Create an image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler to calculate the 
YAP/TAZ ratio between nucleus and the cytoplasm in this dataset.


**Analysis strategy:**

- (Image preprocessing)
- Segment nuclei and cytoplasm
- Assign each cytoplasm one nucleus
- Measure intensity parameters for nucleus and cytoplasm
- Calculate Yap/Taz Ratio
- Export the results

### üß≠ Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Instructions

Starting CellProfiler:

**JupyterHub**

Click on the **CellProfiler** icon.


**HIVE**

Open the Anaconda Prompt and type: 
```bash
conda activate cellprofiler-cellpose
cellprofiler
```


---

#### üìÇ Step 1: Load Your Images

* Right click on the "Drop field" --> "Browse for Folder"
* Select your dataset directory (> 1_BasicsOfImageAnalysis > 3_Hands-On_Cellprofiler > Data)


---

#### üîñ Step 2: Metadata

* In **Metadata**, extract image identifiers.
	- choose "Extract metadata?": Yes
	- select "Metadata extraction method": Extract from image file headers
	- click on "Extract metadata"
	- at the table below, click "Update"
	

---

#### üßπ Step 3: NamesAndTypes

* In **NamesAndTypes**, assign channels:
	- "Assign a name to" : "Images matching rules"
	- Assign "Nuclei" to images containing "C1" in their file names. 
	- Attention: Here the assignemnt is different - not based on the metadata, but based on the filename.
	Select "Add another image" and assign "Actin" to files containing ""C2". 
	Continue with ‚ÄúTubulin‚Äù for ‚ÄúC3‚Äù and ‚ÄúYapTaz‚Äù for ‚ÄúC4‚Äù. 
		* **C1**: Nuclei
		* **C2**: Actin
		* **C3**: Tubulin
		* **C4**: YapTaz
	- Click on the Update button to display a table that shows each channel pair matched up for the wells in the assay.

---

Start **Test Mode**

---

#### ‚ö™ Step 4: Identify Nuclei

* Add a **RunCellpose** module

  * Select the appropriate detection mode for nuclei
  * Select your input image ("Nuclei")
  * Typical diameter: 10-30 pixels
  * Give a meaningful name to your output object (e.g. "Nuclei_Segmentation")
  * Review segmentation overlay and adjust diameter or threshold settings until nuclei are well separated.

---

#### üåê Step 5: Identify Cell Bodies (Cytoplasm)

* Add a **RunCellpose** module

  * Select the appropriate detection mode for cytoplasm
  * Select your input image ("Actin")
  * Typical diameter: 50-80 pixels
  * Give a meaningful name to your output object (e.g. "Cytoplasm_Segmentation")
  * Review segmentation overlay and adjust diameter or threshold settings until nuclei are well separated.

---

#### üîó Step 6: Relate Objects

* Add **RelateObjects** to verify each cytoplasm is assigned to its nucleus.
* Choose "Cytoplasm_Segmentation" as Parent Object and "Nuclei_Segmentation" as Child Objects
* Save the children with parents as new object set with a meaningful name (e.g. "Nuclei_Seg_Relate")

---

#### üìä Step 7: Measure Intensities

* Add **MeasureObjectIntensity**

  * Measure YAP/TAZ channel intensities in both nuclei and cytoplasm objects.
  * You need to select the images that you'd like to measure ("YapTaz")
  * You also need to select the objects that you'd like to measure ("Nuclei_Seg_Relate")

---

#### ‚ûó Step 8: Compute YAP/TAZ Ratio

* Add **CalculateMath**

  * Formula: `IntegratedIntensity_Nucleus / IntegratedIntensity_Cytoplasm`
  * Name the output measurement **`YAP_TAZ_ratio`**

!!! tip
	If you get stuck here, you might want to check out the example project "ImageAnalysis_ExampleProject_RatioMeasurement.cpproj" ;-)
  
---

#### üíæ Step 9: Export Results

* Add **ExportToSpreadsheet**

  * Select measurements: `YAP_TAZ_ratio`, object IDs, metadata
  * Choose CSV output path (e.g., `results/YAP_TAZ_ratios.csv`)
  
* Save your pipeline via **File > Save Project As** (e.g., `YAP_TAZ_pipeline.cpproj`).


---

#### üîÑ Step 10: Analyse your images in Batch‚Äëprocess

* Once your pipeline is finished, you can hit "Analyze Images" and start analysis!

#### Exercises:

üß∞ **Task:** <br>
Inspect the results output for both images and results table

üß∞ **Task:** <br>
Add another measurement module from the ‚ÄúMeasurement‚Äù module category and configure it. 
Which modules make sense, which don‚Äôt? <br>
You can find more info on the measurements here: https://cellprofiler-manual.s3.amazonaws.com/CellProfiler-4.2.6/modules/measurement.html

üß∞ **Task:** <br>
Open the *ImageAnalysis_ExampleProject_RatioMeasurement.cpproj"*.
What is the purpose the **GrayToColor**, **OverlayOutlines**, **DisplayDataOnImage**, and **SaveImages** modules?
Why is it a good idea to add them to your pipeline?


üß∞ **Task:** <br>
The cytoplasm segmentation actually includes the nucleus - what would a better approach be?
Can you subtract the nucleus from the cytoplasm? Which module would you choose?
Hint: Create a tertiary object ...
