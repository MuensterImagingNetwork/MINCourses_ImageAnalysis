# Reproducible Image Analysis

Reproducible image analysis is crucial in biomedical research as it ensures reliable and 
trustworthy results. With increasing data complexity, the risk of human error and bias grows. 
Standardized protocols, transparent methods, and automated workflows guarantee that results 
can be replicated and validated, which is vital for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and 
personalized medicine. By adopting reproducible image analysis practices, researchers can 
increase confidence in their results, reduce errors, and accelerate scientific progress.

### Automated Image Analysis

Automated image analysis offers several advantages that contribute to reproducibility, including:

- **Objective**: reducing human bias and increasing accuracy
- **Quantitative**: deriving statistics and numerical data from images
- **Measuring multiple properties** at once: analyzing various aspects of an image simultaneously, saving time
- **Single cell measurements**: enabling the study of cellular heterogeneity
- **Detection of subtle changes**: identifying differences that may not be visible to the naked eye
- **Faster than manual analysis**: accelerating the analysis process through automation

### Tools Analysis Pipelines

Automated image analysis can be efficiently managed and reproduced through the use of specialized tools, specifically analysis pipelines, which offer the following benefits:

- Pipeline consists of different modules/operations
- Have to be added in a specific order
- Modules can be individually fine-tuned
- Will be run sequentially
- Custom-code possible
- Documentation included
