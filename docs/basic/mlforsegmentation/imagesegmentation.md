### Image Segmentation

Image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning or dividing an image into different regions or components. 
This is typically done to extract relevant information from an image, such as the identification and analysis of specific structures or features.
In the context of biological imaging, this typically means identifying and isolating specific cells or organelles within an image. 
Image segmentation is useful because it enables researchers to extract meaningful information from images, such as object size, shape, location, 
and distribution, which can be used to understand biological processes and phenomena.

Traditional approaches to image segmentation rely on manually defining rules-based algorithms that separate objects from the background based on 
their intensity, texture, or other visual characteristics. These algorithms often involve techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and 
region growing. For example, a researcher might use thresholding to separate cells from the background by setting a minimum intensity value, above 
which pixels are considered part of a cell. While these traditional approaches can be effective, they often require careful tuning of parameters and 
can be time-consuming to optimize, especially when dealing with complex or heterogeneous images.

Moreover, traditional approaches may struggle with images that exhibit high levels of noise, variability, or ambiguity, leading to incomplete or inaccurate 
segmentations. This is where more advanced techniques, such as machine learning-based approaches, come into play. By leveraging patterns and 
relationships learned from large datasets, machine learning algorithms can automatically identify and segment objects of interest, even in challenging images. 
In the next section, we will explore some of these advanced techniques, including Ilastik, Cellpose, and Stardist, and how they can be applied to improve 
image segmentation in bioimage analysis.
