## 🧪 **Hands-On Cellpose: Segmenting Difficult Cell Images**

### **Background Scenario**

You're working with fluorescent microscopy images of densely packed cells. You’ve tried conventional thresholding and watershed segmentation in Fiji or ImageJ—but the cells are touching, boundaries are unclear, and over- or under-segmentation is a common issue.

**Goal:** Use **Cellpose** to generate accurate cell masks, separating individual cells, even in cluttered images.

---

### 🧰 **What You’ll Need**

* A few example images of your cells (TIFF, PNG, or JPEG)
* [Cellpose GUI](https://www.cellpose.org/) or [Napari + Cellpose plugin](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose)
* Optional: Annotations if you plan to train your own model (advanced)

---

### 🧭 **Step-by-Step Instructions**


#### 📂 Step 1: Load Your Image

* Open your image using **File > Open** in the GUI
* Your image should now appear in grayscale or RGB

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Choose a Pre-Trained Model

* **Model type:** Choose between:

  * **cyto** – for whole-cell segmentation (typical for cytoplasm or membrane-stained images)
  * **nuclei** – for nuclear staining (e.g., DAPI)
* **Flow threshold / cell probability:** Leave default for now
* **Use GPU:** Enable if you have one (optional but faster)

---

#### 📐 Step 3: Set Diameter (Optional)

* Cellpose can automatically estimate object size
* If the automatic result looks off, set a rough **diameter (in pixels)** manually (try 30–50 px to start)

---

#### ▶️ Step 4: Run Segmentation

* Click **“Run segmentation”**
* You’ll see overlaid cell outlines and a segmentation mask
* Evaluate: Are all cells segmented? Are there missed detections or merged objects?

---

#### ✏️ Step 5: Refine or Save

* Use the **brush tool** to manually correct any mistakes if needed
* Export masks as:

  * **Masks** (as image)
  * **Outlines**
  * **CSV** with shape properties
* Save your segmented image using **File > Save**

---

### 🧪 **Challenge Exercise**

Try running Cellpose on:

* A brightfield image of adherent cells
* A DAPI-stained image with clustered nuclei
* A tissue section with mixed cell sizes

Compare results between the **cyto** and **nuclei** models.
Try adjusting the **diameter** or **flow threshold**—what changes?

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

| Pros                       | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Works “out of the box”     | Needs GPU for large images or 3D stacks   |
| Handles crowded cells well | Not ideal for thin, filamentous shapes    |
| Supports brightfield & RGB | May need tuning for unusual imaging types |
| No coding required         | Fine-tuning model requires annotation     |
