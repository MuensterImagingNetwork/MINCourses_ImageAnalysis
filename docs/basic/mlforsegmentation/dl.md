# Deep Learning (DL) in Bioimage Analysis

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful and transformative tool in bioimage 
analysis. Its ability to process large and complex datasets, automatically detect intricate 
patterns, and extract valuable insights has revolutionized the way researchers analyze 
biological images. Deep learning algorithms have proven instrumental in tasks such as image 
segmentation, denoising, and object classification, empowering scientists to explore cellular 
structures and behaviors at unprecedented levels of detail. This website aims to introduce and 
describe some of the most prominent deep learning tools used in bioimage analysis, demonstrating
 their importance in advancing our understanding of cellular biology.

### Basic principles of Deep Learning

At its core, deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks 
to analyze data. These networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that 
process and transform inputs into outputs. In the context of image analysis, the input is 
typically an image, and the output is a predicted label or mask that identifies the objects 
or objects of interest.

### Key Components of Deep Learning for Image Segmentation

- **Large Datasets:** A large collection of annotated images is necessary to train the network and ensure accurate predictions.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A type of neural network that uses convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from images.
- **U-Net Architecture:** A type of neural network that uses a series of convolutional and upsampling layers to extract features from images.

### DL Tools for Cell Segmentation

**StarDist** and **Cellose** are two popular deep learning models for image segmentation. 
These models use a type of U-Net architecture, which consists of a series of convolutional 
and upsampling layers. During training, the network learns to predict a probability map that 
indicates the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a particular class or object. 
The predicted probabilities are then thresholded to produce a binary mask that defines the 
objects or region of interest. Especially Cellpose was trained on a large amount of various image data making it a very powerful tool for cell segmentation.

!!! tip "Advantages of Deep Neural Networks for Image segmentation"
	- Very good at recognizing complex features and patterns in images (if conventional methods fail) 
	- Pre-trained models available, that can often be applied to your data straight away
	- Can be finetuned and retrained for your data (transfer learning)

### Stardist

Stardist leverages deep learning and a star-convex polygon representation to precisely detect 
and segment objects with round or ellipsoid shapes, such as cells and nuclei. Its versatility 
and ability to handle limited training data make it ideal for various biological imaging tasks.

### Cellpose 

Cellpose is a powerful instance segmentation tool that excels in identifying individual cells 
within dense populations. Utilizing a custom-designed loss function and a U-Net-based neural 
network, Cellpose is widely used for cell segmentation in different tissues.
