# Welcome to our Image Anaysis Courses

**Welcome to the MÃ¼nster Imaging Network "Basics of Image Analysis" course!**

This course will provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of bioimage analysis. 
We will cover the essential tools and techniques needed to analyze and understand biological images. 
Through this training, you will learn how to use Fiji, AI tools including Ilastik and Cellpose, and CellProfiler to answer your own research questions.

### General Learning Objectives

The goal of the course is to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to independently perform bioimage analyses and achieve high-quality results. 
We will focus on key topics such as the very basics of image analysis, machine learning for image segmentation, creating publication-quality figures, and integrating various tools.

Upon completing the course, you should be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of bioimage analysis
- Use Fiji, Ilastik, Cellpose, Stardist, and CellProfiler for image analysis
- Create high-quality figures for publications
- Integrate various tools for advanced image analysis tasks
