      "answer": ["In **supervised learning**, the algorithm is trained using labeled dataâ€”images where each pixel or object has been manually assigned to a class (e.g., nucleus vs. background). This allows the model to learn from examples and make accurate predictions on new data. In **unsupervised learning**, the algorithm tries to find patterns or groupings in the image data without any predefined labels, such as clustering pixels based on intensity or texture, but without knowing what those clusters represent biologically."]

These maps are generated by a machine learning model based on the features of the image, and can then be thresholded or post-processed to create accurate segmentation masks."]
